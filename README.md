# PowerBI_Academic_Achievement_Analyzer
**Introduction:**

The "Academic Achievement Analyzer" is a Power BI project designed to explore various factors influencing student academic performance and uncovering potential disparities in outcomes. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset containing student demographics, academic scores, and socio-economic indicators, this project aims to provide insights into equity in education.

**Project Overview:**

This project analyzes student achievement data using Power BI. The data includes student demographics, test scores (average, percentage, and pass rate), distribution of student race/ethnicity and lunch types, parental education level, and parental test preparation course enrollment.

**Dashboard Overview:**

The Power BI dashboard offers interactive visualizations and insights across multiple parameters:\
1.Total Scores: Displays the distribution of total scores achieved by students.\
2.Scores by Gender: Provides a comparison of academic scores between male and female students.\
3.Filtering by Race/Ethnicity: Allows users to filter data based on race/ethnicity to examine performance disparities.\
4.Average Scores by Race/Ethnicity: Illustrates the average scores achieved by different racial/ethnic groups.\
5.Average Scores by Parental Level of Education: Shows the average scores based on the educational level of students' parents.\
6.Average Scores by Lunch Type: Analyzes the impact of lunch type (free/reduced or standard) on academic performance.\
7.Average Scores by Test Preparation Course: Examines the influence of completing a test preparation course on academic scores.\
8.Count of Students by Gender and Race/Ethnicity: Provides a breakdown of student counts by gender and race/ethnicity.\
9.Percentage of Students Passing: Calculates the percentage of students passing across different demographics.

**Insights Gained:**

1.Gender Disparity: There is a noticeable difference in academic performance between male and female students, with females generally outperforming males.\
2.Socio-economic Factors: Students with parents having higher levels of education tend to achieve higher average scores. Additionally, students receiving free/reduced lunch show lower average scores compared to those on paid lunch plans.\
3.Test Preparation Impact: Completion of test preparation courses correlates with higher academic scores, indicating its positive influence on student performance.\
4.Subject-based Performance: Analysis reveals varying performance levels across math, physics, and chemistry. Further investigation is warranted to identify underlying reasons for these differences.\
5.Racial/Ethnic Disparities: Significant performance gaps exist among different racial/ethnic groups. Understanding and addressing these disparities are crucial for promoting equity in education.
